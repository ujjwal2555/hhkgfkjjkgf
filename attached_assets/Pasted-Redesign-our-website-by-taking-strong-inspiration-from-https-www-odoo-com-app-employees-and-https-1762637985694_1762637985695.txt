Redesign our website by taking strong inspiration from https://www.odoo.com/app/employees
 and https://www.odoo.com/app/sales
.
The new website should look professionally designed by humans, not AI-generated — authentic, polished, and brand-specific, with personality and attention to detail.

🎨 Design Style & Aesthetic

Adopt a modern, minimalistic, and professional look, similar to Odoo’s clean interface.

Use soft pastel gradients, neutral backgrounds, and rounded cards or sections to create depth without clutter.

Avoid repetitive AI-styled patterns, overly symmetrical layouts, or generic stock visuals.

Every section should feel purposeful and handcrafted, with proper alignment, spacing, and flow.

Include human design touches — asymmetrical grids, slightly offset illustrations, layered visuals, and varied typography weights.

The design should feel alive and intuitive, not algorithmic or overly polished.

🖋 Typography

Use modern sans-serif fonts like Inter, Poppins, or Nunito Sans — clean, legible, and balanced.

Headings should be bold, confident, and elegant, using slightly larger line heights to give breathing space.

Body text should be medium-weight, 16–18px for readability, with smooth color contrast (not pitch black).

Use font pairings (e.g., Poppins for headers + Inter for body) to create visual rhythm.

All text should have consistent margins, spacing, and subtle animations on scroll (e.g., fade-in).

🎨 Color Palette

Primary Colors: Soft lavender or violet hues (inspired by Odoo).

Secondary Colors: Muted gray tones, off-white, and gentle blues.

Accent Colors: Gradient blends (like purple-to-blue or orange-to-pink) for buttons and highlights.

Keep color usage minimal — rely on whitespace and contrast instead of heavy saturation.

Ensure every color combination is accessible and pleasant on the eyes.

📐 Layout & Structure

Hero Section: Large, clean headline, supporting subtext, elegant call-to-action button, and an original illustration or product image.

Feature Sections: Use soft shadowed cards with icons and brief, clear descriptions.

Visual Demo or Screenshot Area: Layered interface mockups with depth and subtle motion effects.

Testimonials/Team Section: Realistic profile photos with natural layouts (avoid generic AI avatars).

Call-to-Action (CTA): Prominent and friendly, with hover animations and gradient button backgrounds.

Footer: Structured and balanced, with muted background color and neat link arrangement.

🎬 Visual & Motion Design

Add smooth scrolling animations, hover highlights, and fade-in transitions — not too flashy, just enough to feel dynamic.

Use vector illustrations or custom graphics with a cohesive color style (avoid generic stock or AI-drawn art).

Maintain consistent iconography and spacing between visual elements.

Microinteractions (like button ripples or icon movements) should feel natural and manually crafted.

⚙️ UX & Technical Details

Fully responsive for all devices (desktop, tablet, and mobile).

Optimized for speed and accessibility.

Use handcrafted layout variations between sections to avoid the "AI template" look.

Integrate authentic visuals or human-centered photography where possible.

Maintain clean code structure for easy updates and SEO optimization.
